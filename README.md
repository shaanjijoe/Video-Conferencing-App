For Access token keys and refresh token keys, open terminal and do the following:
STEP 1 : Type node.
STEP 2 : Type: require('crypto').randomBytes(128).toString('hex')
The above give a random 128 bit code in hexadecimal
Doing so again will give another random set which can be used for refresh token
